# Laser Security System using Arduino

This project implements a **Laser-Based Security System** powered by Arduino, designed to enhance security and detect unauthorized access through the use of laser light and a light-dependent sensor (LDR). The system triggers an alarm via a buzzer whenever irregular activity is detected, making it an efficient and reliable security measure.

## 📖 **Introduction**

The **Laser Security System** is an advanced security measure that uses a laser beam and an LDR sensor to detect intrusion. When the laser beam is interrupted by unauthorized movement or activity, the system triggers a buzzer alarm. This technology provides:
- Enhanced security compared to traditional systems.
- Real-time alerts for irregular activity.
- Versatility for applications in safety lockers, boundaries, and more.

## 🔑 **Applications**

1. **Home Safety Lockers**: Acts as an additional layer of security, even if the locker code is hacked.
2. **Boundary Monitoring**: Monitors boundaries for pets, children, or unauthorized access.
3. **IoT Integration**: Can be expanded for smart monitoring and notifications.

## 🎯 **Objective**

- Enhance security by detecting unauthorized access.
- Provide real-time alerts through IoT platforms.
- Deter intruders and safeguard premises.
- Enable remote monitoring and control.
- Reduce false alarms using advanced detection algorithms.
- Integrate with other IoT devices for a smart security solution.
